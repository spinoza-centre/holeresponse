	abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) benefits from both increased sensitivity and specificity with increasing magnetic field strength, making it a key application for Ultra-High Field (UHF) MRI scanners. Most UHF-fMRI studies utilize the dramatic increases in sensitivity and specificity to acquire high-resolution data reaching sub-millimeter scales, which enable new classes of experiments to probe the functional organization of the human brain. This review article surveys advanced data analysis strategies developed for high-resolution fMRI at UHF. These include strategies designed to mitigate distortion and artifacts associated with higher fields in ways that attempt to preserve spatial resolution of the fMRI data, as well as recently introduced analysis techniques that are enabled by these extremely high-resolution data. Particular focus is placed on anatomically-informed analyses, including cortical surface-based analysis, which are powerful techniques that can guide each step of the analysis from preprocessing to statistical analysis to interpretation and visualization. New intracortical analysis techniques for laminar and columnar fMRI are also reviewed and discussed. Prospects for single-subject individualized analyses are also presented and discussed. Altogether, there are both specific challenges and opportunities presented by UHF-fMRI, and the use of proper analysis strategies can help these valuable data reach their full potential.},

	abstract = {The mesoscopic organization of the human neocortex is of great interest for cognitive neuroscience. However, fMRI in humans typically maps the functional units of cognitive processing on a macroscopic level. With the advent of ultra-high field MRI (≥7T), it has become possible to acquire fMRI data with sub-millimetre resolution, enabling probing the laminar and columnar circuitry in humans. Currently, laminar BOLD responses are not directly observed but inferred via data analysis, due to coarse spatial resolution of fMRI (e.g. 0.7–0.8 mm isotropic) relative to the extent of histological laminae. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for mapping the cortical BOLD response at the spatial scale of cortical layers and columns at 7T (an unprecedented 0.1 mm, either in the laminar or columnar direction). We demonstrate experimentally and using simulations, the superiority of the novel approach compared to standard approaches for human laminar fMRI in terms of effective spatial resolution in either laminar or columnar direction. In addition, we provide evidence that the laminar BOLD signal profile is not homogeneous even over short patches of cortex. In summary, the proposed novel approach affords the ability to directly study the mesoscopic organization of the human cortex, thus, bridging the gap between human cognitive neuroscience and invasive animal studies.},

A square patch of the screen was made to perceptually pop out as a circumscribed figure by virtue of differences between the orientation or the direction of motion of the texture elements within that patch and the surround. The animals were trained to identify the figure patches by making saccadic eye movements towards their positions. Almost every cell gave a significantly larger response to elements belonging to the figure than to similar elements belonging to the background. The figure- ground response enhancement was present along the entire extent of the patch and was absent as soon as the receptive field was outside the patch. The strength of the effect had no relation with classical receptive field properties like orientation or direction selectivity or receptive field size. The response enhancement had a latency of 30–40 msec relative to the onset of the neuronal response itself. The results show that context modulation within primary visual cortex has a highly sophisticated nature, putting the image features the cells are responding to into their fully evaluated perceptual context.},

	abstract = {We have studied the intrinsic organization of macaque striate cortex by tracing the pattern of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled axons and cell bodies produced by microinjections of HRP into single cortical laminae. Both anterograde and retrograde transport results were used to examine: (1) the pattern of projections from lamina 4C to the superficial layers; (2) the projection from lamina 4C to deeper cortical layers; and (3) the projections to lamina 4C from other cortical laminae. Laminae 4C alpha and 4C beta differ in their pattern of projections to the superficial layers of striate cortex. Axons from neurons in lamina 4C beta ascend through lamina 4B without giving off collaterals and terminate in lamina 4A and in the base of lamina 3. By contrast, axons from neurons in lamina 4C alpha terminate in lamina 4B and less densely in the 4A/3B region. The projection from lamina 4C beta to lamina 4A is particularly dense and is distributed in a patchy fashion immediately above each injection site. The projection from lamina 4C beta to lamina 3B appears less dense and more widespread; we estimate that individual 4C beta axons may spread laterally for more than 400 micron. Furthermore, the pattern of HRP-labeled cell bodies in lamina 4C beta following injections into laminae 4A and 3B provides evidence for a subdivision within 4C beta. These injections always produce a large number of labeled neurons in the upper part of lamina 4C beta, whereas the lower portion contains few labeled neurons that are located immediately under the center of the injection site. Both lamina 4C alpha and lamina 4C beta also contribute less dense projections to the deeper layers of cortex. Lamina 4C beta projects mainly to lamina 6, whereas lamina 4C alpha contributes axon terminals to both lamina 5A and lamina 6. Neurons in lamina 6 provide the bulk of the intracortical projections to lamina 4C. The axons of these neurons are fine in caliber and have a delicate side-spine morphology that is quite distinct from lateral geniculate axon arbors. Neurons in lamina 5A also project onto lamina 4C, but the projections of these neurons appear concentrated in lamina 4C alpha. These results confirm or refine many conclusions about intrinsic connections of striate cortex drawn from Golgi material and suggest new patterns of connections not suspected from previous work.},

This circuitry is described here in the context of a two-level model that distinguishes between feedforward and feedback connections. Embedded within this basic framework is a more complex organization. Within the strictly feedforward pathway, these circuits distribute unique combinations of magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to neurons in layers 2-4B. Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons. Each type forms local connections with a unique relationship to more superficial layers. In the case of layer 6 neurons, these connections are closely related to layer 4 subdivisions receiving input from different functional streams.},

One important property is the spectrotemporal contrast in the acoustic environment: the variation in sound pressure in each frequency band, relative to the mean pressure. We show that neurons in ferret auditory cortex rescale their gain to partially compensate for the spectrotemporal contrast of recent stimulation. When contrast is low, neurons increase their gain, becoming more sensitive to small changes in the stimulus, although the effectiveness of contrast gain control is reduced at low mean levels. Gain is primarily determined by contrast near each neuron's preferred frequency, but there is also a contribution from contrast in more distant frequency bands. Neural responses are modulated by contrast over timescales of ∼100 ms. By using contrast gain control to expand or compress the representation of its inputs, the auditory system may be seeking an efficient coding of natural sounds.},

Subjects received stimulation (vibration of varying amplitudes) to the right thumb (target) with or without concurrent stimulation of the right middle finger (mask). Subjects were less sensitive to target stimulation (psychophysical detection thresholds were higher) when target and mask digits were stimulated concurrently compared with when the target was stimulated in isolation. fMRI voxels in a region of the left postcentral gyrus each responded when either digit was stimulated. A regression model (called a forward model) was used to separate the fMRI measurements from these voxels into two hypothetical channels, each of which responded selectively to only one of the two digits. For the channel tuned to the target digit, responses in the left postcentral gyrus increased with target stimulus amplitude but were suppressed by concurrent stimulation to the mask digit, evident as a shift in the gain of the response functions. For the channel tuned to the mask digit, a constant baseline response was evoked for all target amplitudes when the mask was absent and responses decreased with increasing target amplitude when the mask was concurrently presented. A computational model based on divisive normalization provided a good fit to the measurements for both mask-absent and target + mask stimulation. We conclude that the normalization model can explain cross-digit suppression in human somatosensory cortex, supporting the hypothesis that normalization is a canonical neural computation.},

Here we show that a similar normalization occurs during olfactory processing in the Drosophila antennal lobe. We exploit the orderly anatomy of this circuit to independently manipulate feedforward and lateral input to second-order projection neurons (PNs). Lateral inhibition increases the level of feedforward input needed to drive PNs to saturation, and this normalization scales with the total activity of the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) population. Increasing total ORN activity also makes PN responses more transient. Strikingly, a model with just two variables (feedforward and total ORN activity) accurately predicts PN odor responses. Finally, we show that discrimination by a linear decoder is facilitated by two complementary transformations: the saturating transformation intrinsic to each processing channel boosts weak signals, while normalization helps equalize responses to different stimuli.

The differences between feedforward and recurrent processing could prove pivotal in understanding the distinctions between attentive and pre-attentive vision as well as between conscious and unconscious vision.

Using specific optogenetic inactivation of feedback connections from the secondary visual area (V2), we show how feedback affects neural responses in the primate primary visual cortex (V1). Reducing feedback activity increases V1 cells' receptive field (RF) size, decreases their responses to stimuli confined to the RF, and increases their responses to stimuli extending into the proximal surround, therefore reducing surround suppression. Moreover, stronger reduction of V2 feedback activity leads to progressive increase in RF size and decrease in response amplitude, an effect predicted by a recurrent network model. Our results indicate that feedback modulates RF size, surround suppression and response amplitude, similar to the modulatory effects of visual spatial attention.},

These methods build on conventional visual field mapping that measures responses to ring and wedge patterns shown at a series of visual field locations and estimates the single position in the visual field that produces the largest response. The new method computes a model of the population receptive field from responses to a wide range of stimuli and estimates the visual field map as well as other neuronal population properties, such as receptive field size and laterality. The visual field maps obtained with the pRF method are more accurate than those obtained using conventional visual field mapping, and we trace with high precision the visual field maps to the center of the foveal representation. We report quantitative estimates of pRF size in medial, lateral and ventral occipital regions of human visual cortex. Also, we quantify the amount of input from ipsi- and contralateral visual fields. The human pRF size estimates in V1-V3 agree well with electrophysiological receptive field measurements at a range of eccentricities in corresponding locations within monkey and human visual field maps. The pRF method is non-invasive and can be applied to a wide range of conditions when it is useful to link fMRI signals in the visual pathways to neuronal receptive fields. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The debate relates to the balance between plasticity and stability of the underlying neural circuitry. We propose that to move the debate forward, the field needs to define the implied mechanism. First, we review the pRF changes in both healthy subjects and those with clinical disorders. Then, we propose a computational model that describes how pRFs can change in healthy humans.

	abstract = {Recent methodological advances in fMRI contrast and readout strategies have allowed researchers to approach the mesoscopic spatial regime of cortical layers. This has revolutionized the ability to map cortical information processing within and across brain systems. However, until recently, most layer-fMRI studies have been confined to primary cortices using basic block-design tasks and macro-vascular-contaminated sequence contrasts. To become an established method for user-friendly applicability in neuroscience practice, layer-fMRI acquisition and analysis methods need to be extended to more flexible connectivity-based experiment designs; they must be able to capture subtle changes in brain networks of higher-order cognitive areas, and they should not be spatially biased with unwanted vein signals. In this article, we review the most pressing challenges of layer-dependent fMRI for large-scale neuroscientific applicability and describe recently developed acquisition methodologies that can resolve them. In doing so, we review technical tradeoffs and capabilities of modern MR-sequence approaches to achieve measurements that are free of locally unspecific vein signal, with whole-brain coverage, sub-second sampling, high resolutions, and with a combination of those capabilities. The presented approaches provide whole-brain layer-dependent connectivity data that open a new window to investigate brain network connections. We exemplify this by reviewing a number of candidate tools for connectivity analyses that will allow future studies to address new questions in network neuroscience. The considered network analysis tools include: hierarchy mapping, directional connectomics, source-specific connectivity mapping, and network sub–compartmentalization. We conclude: Whole-brain layer-fMRI without large-vessel contamination is applicable for human neuroscience and opens the door to investigate biological mechanisms behind any number of psychological and psychiatric phenomena, such as selective attention, hallucinations and delusions, and even conscious perception.},

Data from non-human primate histology shows that connections between lower to higher areas (e.g. retina→V1), and between higher to lower areas (e.g. V1←V2) can be dissociated based upon the distribution of afferent synapses at the laminar level. Ultra-high field scanners opened up the possibility to image brain structure and function at an unprecedented level of detail. Taking advantage of the increased spatial resolution available, it could theoretically be possible to disentangle activity from different cortical depths from human cerebral cortex, separately studying different compartments across depth. Here we use half-millimeter human functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, MRI) to derive laminar profiles in early visual cortex using a paradigm known to elicit two separate responses originating from an excitatory and a suppressive source, avoiding any contamination due to blood-stealing. We report the shape of laminar blood level oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) profiles from the excitatory and suppressive conditions. We analyse positive and negative \%BOLD laminar profiles with respect to the dominating linear trend towards the pial surface, a confounding feature of gradient echo BOLD fMRI, and examine the correspondence with the anatomical landmark of input-related signals in primary visual cortex, the stria of Gennari.},

However, it is unknown to what level human fMRI is specific and sensitive enough to reveal directional functional activity across layers. To answer this question, we developed acquisition and analysis methods for blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral-blood-volume (CBV)-based laminar fMRI and used these to discriminate four different tasks in the human motor cortex (M1). In agreement with anatomical data from animal studies, we found evidence for somatosensory and premotor input in superficial layers of M1 and for cortico-spinal motor output in deep layers. Laminar resting-state fMRI showed directional functional connectivity of M1 with somatosensory and premotor areas. Our findings demonstrate that CBV-fMRI can be used to investigate cortical activity in humans with unprecedented detail, allowing investigations of information flow between brain regions and outperforming conventional BOLD results that are often buried under vascular biases. Huber et al. demonstrate an MRI method to measure brain activity changes at the spatial resolution of cortical layers in humans.

Since its inception, tens of thousands of studies using techniques such as functional MRI and diffusion weighted imaging have allowed for the non-invasive study of the brain. Despite the fact that MRI is routinely used to obtain data for neuroscience research, there has been no widely adopted standard for organizing and describing the data collected in an imaging experiment. This renders sharing and reusing data (within or between labs) difficult if not impossible and unnecessarily complicates the application of automatic pipelines and quality assurance protocols. To solve this problem, we have developed the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), a standard for organizing and describing MRI datasets.

	abstract = {In addition to bottom-up input, the visual cortex receives large amounts of feedback from other cortical areas [1–3]. One compelling example of feedback activation of early visual neurons in the absence of bottom-up input occurs during the famous Kanizsa illusion, where a triangular shape is perceived, even in regions of the image where there is no bottom-up visual evidence for it. This illusion increases the ﬁring activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex with a receptive ﬁeld on the illusory contour [4]. Feedback signals are largely segregated from feedforward signals within each cortical area, with feedforward signals arriving in the middle layer, while top-down feedback avoids the middle layers and predominantly targets deep and superﬁcial layers [1, 2, 5, 6]. Therefore, the feedback-mediated activity increase in V1 during the perception of illusory shapes should lead to a speciﬁc laminar activity proﬁle that is distinct from the activity elicited by bottom-up stimulation. Here, we used fMRI at high ﬁeld (7 T) to empirically test this hypothesis, by probing the cortical response to illusory ﬁgures in human V1 at different cortical depths [7–14]. We found that, whereas bottom-up stimulation activated all cortical layers, feedback activity induced by illusory ﬁgures led to a selective activation of the deep layers of V1. These results demonstrate the potential for non-invasive recordings of neural activity with laminar speciﬁcity in humans and elucidate the role of top-down signals during perceptual processing.},

	abstract = {Within vision research retinotopic mapping and the more general receptive field estimation approach constitute not only an active field of research in itself but also underlie a plethora of interesting applications. This necessitates not only good estimation of population receptive fields (pRFs) but also that these receptive fields are consistent across time rather than dynamically changing. It is therefore of interest to maximize the accuracy with which population receptive fields can be estimated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) setting. This, in turn, requires an adequate estimation framework providing the data for population receptive field mapping. More specifically, adequate decisions with regard to stimulus choice and mode of presentation need to be made. Additionally, it needs to be evaluated whether the stimulation protocol should entail mean luminance periods and whether it is advantageous to average the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal across stimulus cycles or not. By systematically studying the effects of these decisions on pRF estimates in an empirical as well as simulation setting we come to the conclusion that a bar stimulus presented at random positions and interspersed with mean luminance periods is generally most favorable. Finally, using this optimal estimation framework we furthermore tested the assumption of temporal consistency of population receptive fields. We show that the estimation of pRFs from two temporally separated sessions leads to highly similar pRF parameters.},

To determine the relative contribution of these sources, we recorded physiological (respiration and cardiac) signals simultaneously with fMRI in human volunteers at rest with their eyes closed. State-of-the-art technology was used including high magnetic field (7 T), a multichannel detector array and high-resolution (3 mm3) echo-planar imaging. We investigated the relative contribution of thermal noise and other sources of variance to the observed fMRI signal fluctuations both in the visual cortex and in the whole brain gray matter. The following sources of variance were evaluated separately: low-frequency drifts due to scanner instability, effects correlated with respiratory and cardiac cycles, effects due to variability in the respiratory flow rate and cardiac rate, and other sources, tentatively attributed to spontaneous neuronal activity. We found that low-frequency drifts are the most significant source of fMRI signal fluctuations (3.0\% signal change in the visual cortex, TE=32 ms), followed by spontaneous neuronal activity (2.9\%), thermal noise (2.1\%), effects due to variability in physiological rates (respiration 0.9\%, heartbeat 0.9\%), and correlated with physiological cycles (0.6\%). We suggest the selection and use of four lagged physiological noise regressors as an effective model to explain the variance related to fluctuations in the rates of respiration volume change and cardiac pulsation. Our results also indicate that, compared to the whole brain gray matter, the visual cortex has higher sensitivity to changes in both the rate of respiration and the spontaneous resting-state activity. Under the conditions of this study, spontaneous neuronal activity is one of the major contributors to the measured fMRI signal fluctuations, increasing almost twofold relative to earlier experiments under similar conditions at 3 T.},

To address these problems we have developed pycortex, a Python toolbox for interactive surface mapping and visualization. Pycortex exploits the power of modern graphics cards to sample volumetric data on a per-pixel basis, allowing dense and accurate mapping of the voxel grid across the surface. Anatomical and functional information can be projected onto the cortical surface. The surface can be inflated and flattened interactively, aiding interpretation of the correspondence between the anatomical surface and the flattened cortical sheet. The output of pycortex can be viewed using WebGL, a technology compatible with modern web browsers. This allows complex fMRI surface maps to be distributed broadly online without requiring installation of complex software.},

	abstract = {We investigated the spatiotemporal activation pattern, produced by one visual stimulus, across cerebral cortical regions in awake monkeys. Laminar profiles of postsynaptic potentials and action potentials were indexed with current source density (CSD) and multiunit activity profiles respectively. Locally, we found contrasting activation profiles in dorsal and ventral stream areas. The former, like V1 and V2, exhibit a 'feedforward' profile, with excitation beginning at the depth of Lamina 4, followed by activation of the extragranular laminae. The latter often displayed a multilaminar/columnar profile, with initial responses distributed across the laminae and reflecting modulation rather than excitation; CSD components were accompanied by either no changes or by suppression of action potentials. System-wide, response latencies indicated a large dorsal/ventral stream latency advantage, which generalizes across a wide range of methods. This predicts a specific temporal ordering of dorsal and ventral stream components of visual analysis, as well as specific patterns of dorsal-ventral stream interaction. Our findings support a hierarchical model of cortical organization that combines serial and parallel elements. Critical in such a model is the recognition that processing within a location typically entails multiple temporal components or 'waves' of activity, driven by input conveyed over heterogeneous pathways from the retina.},

Although these improvements enabled researchers to study the human brain to unprecedented spatial resolution, the blood pooling effect reduces the spatial specificity of the widely-used gradient-echo BOLD acquisitions. In this context, vascular space occupancy (VASO-CBV) imaging may be advantageous since it is proposed to have a higher spatial specificity than BOLD. We hypothesized that the assumed higher specificity of VASO-CBV imaging would translate to reduced overlap in fine-scale digit representation maps compared to BOLD-based digit maps. We used sub-millimeter resolution VASO fMRI at 7 T to map VASO-CBV and BOLD responses simultaneously in the motor and somatosensory cortices during individual finger movement tasks. We assessed the cortical overlap in different ways, first by calculating similarity coefficient metrics (DICE and Jaccard) and second by calculating selectivity measures. In addition, we demonstrate a consistent topographical organization of the targeted digit representations (thumb-index-little finger) in the motor areas. We show that the VASO-CBV responses yielded less overlap between the digit clusters than BOLD, and other selectivity measures were higher for VASO-CBV too. In summary, these results were consistent across metrics and participants, confirming the higher spatial specificity of VASO-CBV compared to BOLD.},

Specifically, since pRF size estimates also depend on vascular sources, we hypothesized that reduced vascular blurring might yield narrower pRFs for VASO-CBV measurements. We used a VASO sequence with a double readout 3D EPI sequence at 7T to simultaneously measure VASO-CBV and BOLD responses in the visual cortex while participants viewed conventional pRF mapping stimuli. Both VASO-CBV and BOLD images show similar eccentricity and polar angle maps across all participants. Compared to BOLD-based measurements, VASO-CBV yielded lower tSNR and variance explained. The pRF size changed with eccentricity similarly for VASO-CBV and BOLD, and the pRF size estimates were similar for VASO-CBV and BOLD, even when we equate variance explained between VASO-CBV and BOLD. This result suggests that the vascular component of the pRF size is not dominating in either VASO-CBV or BOLD.},

The large-scale spatial organization of visual cortex can be measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while subjects view spatially modulated visual stimuli, also known as “retinotopic mapping.” One of the datasets collected by the Human Connectome Project involved ultrahigh-field (7 Tesla) fMRI retinotopic mapping in 181 healthy young adults (1.6-mm resolution), yielding the largest freely available collection of retinotopy data. Here, we describe the experimental paradigm and the results of model-based analysis of the fMRI data. These results provide estimates of population receptive field position and size. Our analyses include both results from individual subjects as well as results obtained by averaging fMRI time series across subjects at each cortical and subcortical location and then fitting models. Both the group-average and individual-subject results reveal robust signals across much of the brain, including occipital, temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex as well as subcortical areas. The group-average results agree well with previously published parcellations of visual areas. In addition, split-half analyses show strong within-subject reliability, further demonstrating the high quality of the data. We make publicly available the analysis results for individual subjects and the group average, as well as associated stimuli and analysis code. These resources provide an opportunity for studying fine-scale individual variability in cortical and subcortical organization and the properties of high-resolution fMRI. In addition, they provide a set of observations that can be compared with other Human Connectome Project measures acquired in these same participants.},

Sixteen healthy human participants completed two scanning sessions separated by 10–114 days. Individual participants showed very similar visual field maps for V1-V4 on both sessions. Intersession reliability for eccentricity and polar angle estimates was close to ceiling for most visual field maps (r{\textgreater}.8 for V1-3). PRF size and cortical magnification (CMF) estimates showed strong but lower overall intersession reliability (r≈.4–.6). Group level results for pRF size and CMF were highly similar between sessions. Additional control experiments confirmed that reliability does not depend on the carrier stimulus used and that reliability for pRF size and CMF is high for sessions acquired on the same day (r{\textgreater}.6). Our results demonstrate that pRF mapping is highly reliable across sessions.},

The most popular pRF model used in fMRI assumes a Gaussian shape in the features space (e.g., the visual field) reducing the description of the voxel’s pRF to the Gaussian mean (the pRF preferred feature) and standard deviation (the pRF size). The estimation of the pRF mean has been proven to be highly reliable. However, the estimate of the pRF size has been shown not to be consistent within and between subjects. While this issue has been noted experimentally, here we use an optimization theory perspective to describe how the inconsistency in estimating the pRF size is linked to an inherent property of the Gaussian pRF model. When fitting such models, the goodness of fit is less sensitive to variations in the pRF size than to variations in the pRF mean. We also show how the same issue can be considered from a bias-variance perspective. We compare different estimation procedures in terms of the reliability of their estimates using simulated and real fMRI data in the visual (using the Human Connectome Project database) and auditory domain. We show that, the reliability of the estimate of the pRF size can be improved considering a linear combination of those pRF models with similar goodness of fit or a permutation based approach. This increase in reliability of the pRF size estimate does not affect the reliability of the estimate of the pRF mean and the prediction accuracy.},

Despite growing interest, no study to date has systematically investigated the effects of different stimulus configurations on pRF estimates from human visual cortex. Here we compared the effects of three different stimulus configurations on a model-based approach to pRF estimation: size-invariant bars and eccentricity-scaled bars defined in Cartesian coordinates and traveling along the cardinal axes, and a novel simultaneous “wedge and ring” stimulus defined in polar coordinates, systematically covering polar and eccentricity axes. We found that the presence or absence of eccentricity scaling had a significant effect on goodness of fit and pRF size estimates. Further, variability in pRF size estimates was directly influenced by stimulus configuration, particularly for higher visual areas including V5/MT+. Finally, we compared eccentricity estimation between phase-encoded and model-based pRF approaches. We observed a tendency for more peripheral eccentricity estimates using phase-encoded methods, independent of stimulus size. We conclude that both eccentricity scaling and polar rather than Cartesian stimulus configuration are important considerations for optimal experimental design in pRF mapping. While all stimulus configurations produce adequate estimates, simultaneous wedge and ring stimulation produced higher fit reliability, with a significant advantage in reduced acquisition time.},

Here, we investigate both in concert, by imaging ocular dominance columns (ODCs) in primary visual cortex (V1) across different cortical depths. We ensured that putative ODC patterns in V1 (a) are stable across runs, sessions, and scanners located in different continents, (b) have a width ({\textasciitilde}1.3 mm) expected from post-mortem and animal work and (c) are absent at the retinotopic location of the blind spot. We then dissociated the effects of bottom-up thalamo-cortical input and attentional feedback processes on activity in V1 across cortical depth. Importantly, the separation of bottom-up information flows into ODCs allowed us to validly compare attentional conditions while keeping the stimulus identical throughout the experiment. We find that, when correcting for draining vein effects and using both model-based and model-free approaches, the effect of monocular stimulation is largest at deep and middle cortical depths. Conversely, spatial attention influences BOLD activity exclusively near the pial surface. Our findings show that simultaneous interrogation of columnar and laminar dimensions of the cortical fold can dissociate thalamocortical inputs from top-down processing, and allow the investigation of their interactions without any stimulus manipulation.},

The DN model parsimoniously captures seemingly disparate response signatures with a single computation, superseding existing pRF models in both performance and biological plausibility. We observe systematic variations in specific DN model parameters across the visual hierarchy and show how they relate to differences in response modulation and visuospatial information integration. The DN model delivers a unifying framework for visuospatial responses throughout the human visual hierarchy and provides insights into its underlying information-encoding computations.

Line-scanning fMRI achieves very high spatial resolution and high sampling rate, at the cost of a sacrifice in volume coverage. Here, we present a human line-scanning implementation on a 7T MRI system. First, we investigate the quality of the saturation pulses that suppress MR signal outside the line. Second, we established the best coil combination for reconstruction. Finally, we applied the line-scanning method in the occipital lobe during a visual stimulation task, showing BOLD responses along cortical depth, every 250?µm with a 200?ms repetition time (TR). We found a good correspondence of t-statistics values with 2D gradient-echo echo planar imaging (GE-EPI) BOLD fMRI data with the same temporal resolution and voxel volume (R?=?0.6?±?0.2).

	abstract = {Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), typically using blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast weighted imaging, allows the study of brain function with millimeter spatial resolution and temporal resolution of one to a few seconds. At a mesoscopic scale, neurons in the human brain are spatially organized in structures with dimensions of hundreds of micrometers, while they communicate at the millisecond timescale. For this reason, it is important to develop an fMRI method with simultaneous high spatial and temporal resolution. Line-scanning promises to reach this goal at the cost of volume coverage. New method: Here, we release a comprehensive update to human line-scanning fMRI. First, we investigated multi-echo line-scanning with five different protocols varying the number of echoes and readout bandwidth while keeping the TR constant. In these, we compared different echo combination approaches in terms of BOLD activation (sensitivity) and temporal signal-to-noise ratio. Second, we implemented an adaptation of NOise reduction with DIstribution Corrected principal component analysis (NORDIC) thermal noise removal for line-scanning fMRI data. Finally, we tested three image-based navigators for motion correction and investigated different ways of performing fMRI analysis on the timecourses which were influenced by the insertion of the navigators themselves. Results: The presented improvements are relatively straightforward to implement; multi-echo readout and NORDIC denoising together, significantly improve data quality in terms of tSNR and t-statistical values, while motion correction makes line-scanning fMRI more robust. Comparison with existing methods: Multi-echo acquisitions and denoising have previously been applied in 3D magnetic resonance imaging. Their combination and application to 1D line-scanning is novel. The current proposed method greatly outperforms the previous line-scanning acquisitions with single-echo acquisition, in terms of tSNR (4.0 for single-echo line-scanning and 36.2 for NORDIC-denoised multi-echo) and t-statistical values (3.8 for single-echo line-scanning and 25.1 for NORDIC-denoised multi-echo line-scanning). Conclusions: Line-scanning fMRI was advanced compared to its previous implementation in order to improve sensitivity and reliability. The improved line-scanning acquisition could be used, in the future, for neuroscientific and clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Cortical inhibition plays an important role in information processing in the brain. However, the mechanisms by which inhibition and excitation are coordinated to generate functions in the six layers of the cortex remain unclear. Here, we measured laminar-specific responses to stimulus orientations in primary visual cortex (V1) of awake monkeys (male, Macaca mulatta ). We distinguished inhibitory effects (suppression) from excitation, by taking advantage of the separability of excitation and inhibition in the orientation and time domains. We found two distinct types of suppression governing different layers. Fast suppression (FS) was strongest in input layers (4C and 6), and slow suppression (SS) was 3 times stronger in output layers (2/3 and 5). Interestingly, the two types of suppression were correlated with different functional properties measured with drifting gratings. FS was primarily correlated with orientation selectivity in input layers ( r = −0.65, p {\textless} 10−9), whereas SS was primarily correlated with surround suppression in output layers ( r = 0.61, p {\textless} 10−4). The earliest SS in layer 1 indicates the origin of cortical feedback for SS, in contrast to the feedforward/recurrent origin of FS. Our results reveal two V1 laminar subnetworks with different response suppression that may provide a general framework for laminar processing in other sensory cortices. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study sought to understand inhibitory effects (suppression) and their relationships with functional properties in the six different layers of the cortex. We found that the diversity of neural responses across layers in primary visual cortex (V1) could be fully explained by one excitatory and two suppressive components (fast and slow suppression). The distinct laminar distributions, origins, and functional roles of the two types of suppression provided a simplified representation of the differences between two V1 subnetworks (input network and output network). These results not only help to elucidate computational principles in macaque V1, but also provide a framework for general computation of cortical laminae in other sensory cortices.},

	abstract = {The firing rates of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are suppressed by large stimuli, an effect known as surround suppression. In cats and monkeys, the strength of suppression is sensitive to orientation; responses to regions containing uniform orientations are more suppressed than those containing orientation contrast. This effect is thought to be important for scene segmentation, but the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. We asked whether it is possible to study these mechanisms in the visual cortex of mice, because of recent advances in technology for studying the cortical circuitry in mice. It is unknown whether neurons in mouse V1 are sensitive to orientation contrast. We measured the orientation selectivity of surround suppression in the different layers of mouse V1. We found strong surround suppression in layer 4 and the superficial layers, part of which was orientation tuned: iso-oriented surrounds caused more suppression than cross-oriented surrounds. Surround suppression was delayed relative to the visual response and orientation-tuned suppression was delayed further, suggesting two separate suppressive mechanisms. Previous studies proposed that surround suppression depends on the activity of inhibitory somatostatin-positive interneurons in the superficial layers. To test the involvement of the superficial layers we topically applied lidocaine. Silencing of the superficial layers did not prevent orientation-tuned suppression in layer 4. These results show that neurons in mouse V1, which lacks orientation columns, show orientation-dependent surround suppression in layer 4 and the superficial layers and that surround suppression in layer 4 does not require contributions from neurons in the superficial layers.},

However, its function is underexplored in vivo, due to its small size, its dense structure and its placement at the bottom of the brain, where transmit and receive fields are suboptimal. In this study, we combined two dense coil arrays of 16 small surface receive elements each with a transmit array of three antenna elements to improve BOLD sensitivity in the human cerebellum at 7 T. Our results showed improved B1+ and SNR close to the surface as well as g-factor gains compared with a commercial coil designed for whole-head imaging. This resulted in improved signal stability and large gains in the spatial extent of the activation close to the surface ({\textless}3.5 cm), while good performance was retained deeper in the cerebellum. Modulating the phase of the transmit elements of the head coil to constructively interfere in the cerebellum improved the B1+, resulting in a temporal SNR gain. Overall, our results show that a dedicated transmit array along with the SNR gains of surface coil arrays can improve cerebellar imaging, at the cost of a decreased field of view and increased signal inhomogeneity.},

	abstract = {Contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation and contextual modulation of primary visual cortex (V1) neuron responses to stimulation of their receptive field reveal long-distance integration of visual signals within V1, well beyond the classical receptive field (cRF) of single neurons. To identify the cortical circuits mediating these long-distance computations, we have used a combination of anatomical and physiological recording methods to determine the spatial scale and retinotopic logic of intra-areal V1 horizontal connections and inter-areal feedback connections to V1. We have then compared the spatial scales of these connectional systems to the spatial dimensions of the cRF, spatial summation field (SF), and modulatory surround field of macaque V1 neurons. We find that monosynaptic horizontal connections within area V1 are of an appropriate spatial scale to mediate interactions within the SF of V1 neurons and to underlie contrast-dependent changes in SF size. Contrary to common beliefs, these connections cannot fully account for the dimensions of the surround field. The spatial scale of feedback circuits from extrastriate cortex to V1 is, instead, commensurate with the full spatial range of center-surround interactions. Thus these connections could represent an anatomical substrate for contextual modulation and global-to-local integration of visual signals. Feedback projections connect corresponding and equal-sized regions of the visual field in striate and extrastriate cortices and cover anisotropic parts of visual space, unlike V1 horizontal connections that are isotropic in the macaque. V1 isotropic connectivity demonstrates that anisotropic horizontal connections are not necessary to generate orientation selectivity. Anisotropic feedback connections may play a role in contour completion.},

	abstract = {Single cell recordings in monkey striate cortex have shown differences in response properties from one cell layer to the next and have also shown that the IVth layer, which receives most of its input from the geniculate, is subdivided into a mosaic of regions, some connected to the left eye, others to the right. In the present study small lesions were made in single layers or pairs of layers in the lateral geniculate body, and the striate cortex was later examined with a Fink‐Heimer modification of the Nauta method. We hoped to correlate the laminar distribution of axon terminals in the cortex with functional differences between layers, and to demonstrate the IVth‐layer mosaic anatomically. After lesions in either of the two most dorsal (parvocellular) layers, terminal degeneration was found mainly in layer IVc, with a second minor input to a narrow band in the upper part of IVa. A very few degenerating fibers ascended to layer I. In contrast, lesions in either of the two ventral (magnocellular) layers were followed by terminal degeneration confined, apparently, to IVb, or at times extending for a short distance into the upper part of IVc; no degeneration was seen in layer IVa or in layer I. After a lesion confined to a single geniculate layer, a section through the corresponding region of striate cortex showed discrete areas or bands of degeneration in layer IV, usually 0.5–1.0 mm long, separated by interbands of about the same extent in which there was no terminal degeneration. When serial sections were reconstructed to obtain a face‐on view of the layer‐IV mosaic, it appeared as a series of regular, parallel, alternating degeneration‐rich and degeneration‐poor stripes. When a geniculate lesion involved both layer VI (the most dorsal, with input from the contralateral eye) and the part of layer V directly below (ipsilateral eye), the cortical degeneration, as expected, occupied a virtually continuous strip in layer IVc and the reconstructed face‐on view of this layer showed a large confluent region of degeneration. In some of the reconstructions the cortical stripes seemed highly regular; in others there was a variable amount of cross connection between stripes. The stripes varied in width from 0.25 to 0.50 mm, and width did not seem to correlate with region of retinal representation. It is concluded that the long narrow stripes of alternating left‐eye and right‐eye input to layer IV are an anatomical counterpart of the physiologically observed ocular‐dominance columns. Because of this segregation of inputs, cells of layer IV are almost invariably influenced by one eye only. A cell above or below layer IV will be dominated by the eye supplying the nearest IVth layer stripe, but will generally, though not always, receive a subsidiary input from the other eye, presumably by diagonal connections from the nearest stripes supplied by that eye.

Human fMRI studies at this scale of the cortical architecture, however, are very rare because the high spatial/temporal resolution required to explore these properties of the BOLD signal are limited by the signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we show that it is possible to detect BOLD signal changes at an isotropic spatial resolution as high as 0.55 mm at 7 T using a high-density multi-element surface coil with minimal electronics, which allows close proximity to the head. The coil comprises of very small, 1×2-cm2, elements arranged in four flexible modules of four elements each (16-channel) that can be positioned within 1 mm from the head. As a result of this proximity, tissue losses were five-fold greater than coil losses and sufficient to exclude preamplifier decoupling. When compared with a standard 16-channel head coil, the BOLD sensitivity was approximately 2.2-fold higher for a high spatial/temporal resolution (1 mm isotropic/0.4 s), multi-slice, echo planar acquisition, and approximately three- and six-fold higher for three-dimensional echo planar images acquired with isotropic resolutions of 0.7 and 0.55 mm, respectively. Improvements in parallel imaging performance (geometry factor) were up to around 1.5-fold with increasing acceleration factor, and improvements in fMRI detectability (temporal signal-to-noise ratio) were up to around four-fold depending on the distance to the coil. Although deeper lying structures may not benefit from the design, most fMRI questions pertain to the neocortex which lies within approximately 4 cm from the surface. These results suggest that the resolution of fMRI (at 7 T) can approximate levels that are closer to the spatial/temporal scale of the fundamental functional organization of the human cortex using a simple high-density coil design for high sensitivity.},

We will review how recent studies are attempting to verify the accuracy of laminar fMRI by recreating the known laminar profiles of various neural tuning properties. Furthermore, we will examine how feedforward and feedback-related neural processes engage different cortical layers, producing canonical patterns of spiking and synaptic activity as estimated by the analysis of current-source density. These results provide a benchmark for recent studies aiming to examine the profiles of bottom-up and top-down processes with laminar fMRI.

	abstract = {The rapid developments in functional MRI (fMRI) acquisition methods and hardware technologies in recent years, particularly at high field (≥7 T), have enabled unparalleled visualization of functional detail at a laminar or columnar level, bringing fMRI close to the intrinsic resolution of brain function. These advances highlight the potential of high resolution fMRI to be a valuable tool to study the fundamental processing performed in cortical micro-circuits, and their interactions such as feedforward and feedback processes. Notably, because fMRI measures neuronal activity via hemodynamics, the ultimate resolution it affords depends on the spatial specificity of hemodynamics to neuronal activity at a detailed spatial scale, and by the evolution of this specificity over time. Several laminar (≤1 mm spatial resolution) fMRI studies have examined spatial characteristics of the measured hemodynamic signals across cortical depth, in light of understanding or improving the spatial specificity of laminar fMRI. Few studies have examined temporal features of the hemodynamic response across cortical depth. Temporal features of the hemodynamic response offer an additional means to improve the specificity of fMRI, and could help target neuronal processes and neurovascular coupling relationships across laminae, for example by differences in the onset times of the response across cortical depth. In this review, we discuss factors that affect the timing of neuronal and hemodynamic responses across laminae, touching on the neuronal laminar organization, and focusing on the laminar vascular organization. We provide an overview of hemodynamics across the cortical vascular tree based on optical imaging studies, and review temporal aspects of hemodynamics that have been examined across cortical depth in high spatiotemporal resolution fMRI studies. Last, we discuss the limits and potential of high spatiotemporal resolution fMRI to study laminar neurovascular coupling and neuronal processes.},

While sensitivity to particle motion or blood flow can be used to provide useful image contrast, bulk motion presents a considerable problem in the majority of clinical applications. It is one of the most frequent sources of artifacts. Over 30 years of research have produced numerous methods to mitigate or correct for motion artifacts, but no single method can be applied in all imaging situations. Instead, a "toolbox" of methods exists, where each tool is suitable for some tasks, but not for others. This article reviews the origins of motion artifacts and presents current mitigation and correction methods. In some imaging situations, the currently available motion correction tools are highly effective; in other cases, appropriate tools still need to be developed. It seems likely that this multifaceted approach will be what eventually solves the motion sensitivity problem in MRI, rather than a single solution that is effective in all situations. This review places a strong emphasis on explaining the physics behind the occurrence of such artifacts, with the aim of aiding artifact detection and mitigation in particular clinical situations. J.

In this review article, we briefly describe the current acquisition techniques for rs-fMRI data, from the most common approaches for resting state acquisition strategies, to more recent investigations with dedicated hardware and ultra-high fields. Specific sequences that allow very fast acquisitions, or multiple echoes, are discussed next. We then consider how acquisition methods weighted towards specific parts of the BOLD signal, like the Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) or Volume (CBV), can provide more spatially specific network information. These approaches are being developed alongside the commonly used BOLD-weighted acquisitions. Finally, specific applications of rs-fMRI to challenging regions such as the laminae in the neocortex, and the networks within the large areas of subcortical white matter regions are discussed. We finish the review with recommendations for acquisition strategies for a range of typical applications of resting state fMRI.},

	abstract = {In recent years, many new cortical areas have been identified in the macaque monkey. The number of identified connections between areas has increased even more dramatically. We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31\% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40\%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40\%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10\% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainties in the reported assignment.},

With the advent of ultra-high field (7T and higher) MRI scanners, it has become possible to perform sub-millimeter resolution fMRI in humans. A novel and promising application of sub-millimeter fMRI is measuring responses across cortical depth, i.e. laminar imaging. However, the cortical vasculature and associated directional blood pooling towards the pial surface strongly influence the cortical depth-dependent BOLD signal, particularly for gradient-echo BOLD. This directional pooling may potentially affect BOLD linearity across cortical depth. Here we assess whether the amplitude scaling assumption for linear systems theory holds across cortical depth. For this, we use stimuli with different luminance contrasts to elicit different BOLD response amplitudes. We find that BOLD amplitude across cortical depth scales with luminance contrast, and that this scaling is identical across cortical depth. Although nonlinearities may be present for different stimulus configurations and acquisition protocols, our results suggest that the amplitude scaling assumption for linear systems theory across cortical depth holds for luminance contrast manipulations in sub-millimeter laminar BOLD fMRI.},

In this study, we characterize the temporal dynamics of the hemodynamic response (HDR) across cortical depth in the human primary motor and visual cortex, at 7 T and using very short stimuli and with high spatial and temporal resolution. We find that the shape and temporal dynamics of the HDR changed in an orderly manner across cortical depth. Compared with the pial vasculature, HDRs in deeper gray matter are significantly faster in onset time (by ∼0.5 second) and peak time (∼2 seconds), and are narrower (by ∼1 second) and with smaller amplitude, in line with the known vascular organization across cortical depth and the transit of deoxygenated blood through the vasculature. The width of the HDR in deeper gray matter was as short as 2.1 seconds, indicating that neurovascular coupling takes place at a shorter timescale than previously reported in the human brain.

We find that near versus far-surround stimuli activate distinct layers, thus revealing unique laminar contributions to the processing of local and global spatial context. Stimuli in the near-surround evoke the earliest subthreshold responses in superficial and upper-deep layers, and earliest suppression of spiking responses in superficial layers.

	abstract = {We used horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to orthogradely label afferent axons in macaque striate cortex. Of the 38 axons that we recovered, nine were recorded intracelhrlarly before being filled with HRP. Light microscope and computer reconstructions of filled processes reveal highly stereotyped patterns of arborization and suggest that there are at least five discrete populations of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) afferent axon: (1) those to layer 4Cp, which have extremely circumscribed, dense terminal fields (small branches of which occasionally intrude into 4Ca) but which have not been shown to project to other laminae; (2) afferents to layer 4A, which in some cases send fine ascending collaterals into layer 2-3 and which do not, apparently, send collaterals to other laminae; (3) afferents to layer 1, which are fine, extend over large distances horizontally, and send collaterals to layer 6A; (4) afferents to the lower two-thirds of layer 4Ca, which have few or no collaterals in layer 6; and (5) afferents to the upper half of layer 4Ca, which have arborizing collaterals in layer 6B. Of the nine axons that were recorded intracellularly, those with projections to layer 4Cp (two axons) and to layer 1 (one axon) had color-selective properties, whereas those (six axons) which arborized in 4Ca all had transient, broad band and highly contrast-sensitive receptive fields. These properties are consistent with derivations from somata in the parvocellular and magnocellular divisions of the LGN, respectively. Afferents to 4Ca were found to cover approximately 6 times as much surface area as afferents to 4Cp. The preterminal trunks of all axons were found to follow tortuous paths through the neuropil-paths that may derive from axon segregation during development. The wide ranging, patchy distributions of single afferents in 4C{\textasciitilde}usuggest that individual 4\& axons supply more than one ocular dominance stripe. In one case where the terminal arborization of a 4Ca axon was mapped against the transneuronally determined pattern of ocular dominance, three separate patches of terminal boutons were indeed found to coincide with the bands of one eye.},

Two efferent systems, each with a specific laminar organization, are observed. (1) Rostrally directed connections, from area 17 to 18, area 18 to 19, and area 19 to the inferotemporal region (area TE), originate from neurons in layer IIIc (and, in area 19, from a small complement of neurons in layer Va), and terminate in and around layer IV. (2) In contrast, connections in the reverse direction ('caudally directed' connections), from area TE to 19, area 19 to 18, and area 18 to 17, originate from neurons in layers Vb, VI and, to a lesser extent, IIIa, and terminate mainly in layer I. In addition, the laminar organization of several intrinsic and callosal connections are observed. Intrinsic connections within areas 18 and 19 originate from neurons in layers IIIc and, to a lesser extent, Va, and terminate in vertical bands in layers I to IV. Callosal connections from areas 18, 19, and the caudal inferotemporal region originate from neurons mainly in layer IIIc. From areas 18 and 19, these callosal connections terminate in vertical bands in layers I through IV. Thus, different cortical projection systems are characterized by specific laminar distributions of efferent terminations as well as of their neurons of origin.},

SM is the ability of stimuli in the surround of a neuron’s receptive ﬁeld (RF) to modulate (typically suppress) the neuron’s response to stimuli simultaneously presented inside the RF, a property thought to underlie optimal coding of sensory information and important perceptual functions. Understanding the circuit and mechanisms for SM can reveal fundamental principles of computations in sensory cortices, from mouse to human. Current debate is centered over whether feedforward or intracortical circuits generate SM, and whether this results from increased inhibition or reduced excitation. Here we present a working hypothesis, based on theoretical and experimental evidence, that SM results from feedforward, horizontal, and feedback interactions with local recurrent connections, via synaptic mechanisms involving both increased inhibition and reduced recurrent excitation. In particular, strong and balanced recurrent excitatory and inhibitory circuits play a crucial role in the computation of SM.},

	abstract = {Depth-resolved functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an emerging field growing in popularity given the potential of separating signals from different computational processes in cerebral cortex. Conventional acquisition schemes suffer from low spatial and temporal resolutions. Line-scanning methods allow depth-resolved fMRI by sacrificing spatial coverage to sample blood oxygenated level-dependent (BOLD) responses at ultra-high temporal and spatial resolution. For neuroscience applications, it is critical to be able to place the line accurately to (1) sample the right neural population and (2) target that neural population with tailored stimuli or tasks. To this end, we devised a multi-session framework where a target cortical location is selected based on anatomical and functional properties. The line is then positioned according to this information in a separate second session, and we tailor the experiment to focus on the target location. Anatomically, the precision of the line placement was confirmed by projecting a nominal representation of the acquired line back onto the surface. Functional estimates of neural selectivities in the line, as quantified by a visual population-receptive field model, resembled the target selectivities well for most subjects. This functional precision was quantified in detail by estimating the distance between the visual field location of the targeted vertex and the location in visual cortex (V1) that most closely resembled the line-scanning estimates; this distance was on average 5.5 mm. Given the dimensions of the line, differences in acquisition, session, and stimulus design, this validates that line-scanning can be used to probe local neural sensitivities across sessions. In summary, we present an accurate framework for line-scanning MRI; we believe such a framework is required to harness the full potential of line-scanning and maximize its utility. Furthermore, this approach bridges canonical fMRI experiments with electrophysiological experiments, which in turn allows novel avenues for studying human physiology non-invasively.},

Using four different echo times at each field strength allowed quantification of the relaxation rate, R2⁎ and the change in relaxation rate on activation, ΔR2⁎. This work adds to previous studies of the field strength dependence of BOLD signal characteristics, through its: (i) focus on motor rather than visual cortex; (ii) use of single-shot, multi-slice, gradient echo EPI for data acquisition; (iii) co-registration of images acquired at different field strengths to allow assessment of the BOLD signal changes in the same region at each field strength. ΔR2⁎ was found to increase linearly with field strength (0.51±0.06 s−1 at 1.5 T; 0.98±0.08 s−1 at 3 T; 2.55±0.22 s−1 at 7 T), while the ratio of ΔR2⁎/R2, which dictates the accessible BOLD contrast was also found to increase (0.042±0.002 at 1.5 T; 0.054±0.002 at 3 T; 0.084±0.003 at 7 T). The number of pixels classified as active, the t-value calculated over a common region of interest and the percentage signal change in the same region were all found to peak at TE∼T2⁎ and increase significantly with field strength. An earlier onset of the haemodynamic response at higher field provides some evidence for a reduced venous contribution to the BOLD signal at 7 T.},

	abstract = {With sufficient image encoding, high-resolution fMRI studies are limited by the biological point-spread of the hemodynamic signal. The extent of this spread is determined by the local vascular distribution and by the spatial specificity of blood flow regulation, as well as by measurement parameters that (i) alter the relative sensitivity of the acquisition to activation-induced hemodynamic changes and (ii) determine the image contrast as a function of vessel size. In particular, large draining vessels on the cortical surface are a major contributor to both the BOLD signal change and to the spatial bias of the BOLD activation away from the site of neuronal activity. In this work, we introduce a laminar surface-based analysis method and study the relationship between spatial localization and activation strength as a function of laminar depth by acquiring 1mm isotropic, single-shot EPI at 7T and sampling the BOLD signal exclusively from the superficial, middle, or deep cortical laminae. We show that highly-accelerated EPI can limit image distortions to the point where a boundary-based registration algorithm accurately aligns the EPI data to the surface reconstruction. The spatial spread of the BOLD response tangential to the cortical surface was analyzed as a function of cortical depth using our surface-based analysis. Although sampling near the pial surface provided the highest signal strength, it also introduced the most spatial error. Thus, avoiding surface laminae improved spatial localization by about 40\% at a cost of 36\% in z-statistic, implying that optimal spatial resolution in functional imaging of the cortex can be achieved using anatomically-informed spatial sampling to avoid large pial vessels.},

	abstract = {An important challenge in the design and analysis of event-related or single-trial functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments is to optimize statistical efficiency, i.e., the accuracy with which the event-related hemodynamic response to different stimuli can be estimated for a given amount of imaging time. Several studies have suggested that using a fixed inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) of at least 15 sec results in optimal statistical efficiency or power and that using shorter ISIs results in a severe loss of power. In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ISIs as short as 500 ms while still maintaining considerable efficiency or power. Here, we attempt to resolve this apparent contradiction by a quantitative analysis of the relative efficiency afforded by different event-related experimental designs. This analysis shows that statistical efficiency falls off dramatically as the ISI gets sufficiently short, if the ISI is kept fixed for all trials. However, if the ISI is properly jittered or randomized from trial to trial, the efficiency improves monotonically with decreasing mean ISI. Importantly, the efficiency afforded by such variable ISI designs can be more than 10 times greater than that which can be achieved by fixed ISI designs. These results further demonstrate the feasibility of using identical experimental designs with fMRI and electro-/magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) without sacrificing statistical power or efficiency of either technique, thereby facilitating comparison and integration across imaging modalities.

This cortical cyto- and myeloarchitecture plays a central role in the anatomical and functional neuroanatomy but is primarily accessible through invasive histology only. To overcome this limitation, several non-invasive MRI approaches have been, and are being, developed to resolve the anatomical cortical layers. As a result, recent studies on large populations and structure-function relationships at the laminar level became possible. Early proof-of-concept studies targeted conspicuous laminar structures such as the stria of Gennari in the primary visual cortex. Recent work characterized the laminar structure outside the visual cortex, investigated the relationship between laminar structure and function, and demonstrated layer-specific maturation effects. This paper reviews the methods and in-vivo MRI studies on the anatomical layers in the human cortex based on conventional and quantitative MRI (excluding diffusion imaging). A focus is on the related challenges, promises and potential future developments. The rapid development of MRI scanners, motion correction techniques, analysis methods and biophysical modeling promise to overcome the challenges of spatial resolution, precision and specificity of systematic imaging of cortical laminae.},

This paper introduces a model of the micro-structural organization of the cortex, which can compensate for the effect of cortical curvature. Layers are modelled by an equivolumic principle, while the vertical structure of the cortex is represented with a Laplacian model. In this framework, lamination profiles can be represented in a way that preserves the original voxel sampling of the acquisition.

Historically, the cortical layers were investigated solely ex-vivo using histological means, but recent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that T1 relaxation images can be utilized to separate the layers. Despite technological advancements in the field of high-resolution MRI, accurate estimation of whole-brain cortical laminar composition has remained limited due to partial volume effects, leaving some layers far beyond the image resolution. In this study, we offer a simple and accurate method for cortical laminar composition analysis, resolving partial volume effects and cortical curvature heterogeneity. We use a low-resolution 3T MRI echo planar imaging inversion recovery (EPI IR) scan protocol that provides fast acquisition ({\textasciitilde} 12 min) and enables extraction of multiple T1 relaxation time components per voxel, which are assigned to types of brain tissue and utilized to extract the subvoxel composition of six T1 layers. While previous investigation of the layers required the estimation of cortical normals or smoothing of layer widths (similar to VBM), here we developed a sphere-based approach to explore the inner mesoscale architecture of the cortex. Our novel algorithm conducts spatial analysis using volumetric sampling of a system of virtual spheres dispersed throughout the entire cortical space. The methodology offers a robust and powerful framework for quantification and visualization of the cortical laminar structure on the cortical surface, providing a basis for quantitative investigation of its role in cognition, physiology and pathology.},

However, on a ﬁner scale, invasive electrical stimulation studies show deviations from this somatotopic organization that suggest an organizing principle based on motor actions rather than body part moved. It has not been clear how the action-map organization principle of the motor cortex in the mesoscopic (sub-millimeter) regime integrates into a body map organization principle on a macroscopic scale (cm). Here we developed and applied advanced mesoscopic (sub-millimeter) fMRI and analysis methodology to non-invasively investigate the functional organization topography across columnar and laminar structures in humans. Compared to previous methods, in this study, we could capture locally speciﬁc blood volume changes across entire brain regions along the cortical curvature. We ﬁnd that individual ﬁngers have multiple mirrored representations in the primary motor cortex depending on the movements they are involved in. We ﬁnd that individual digits have cortical representations up to 3 mm apart from each other arranged in a column-like fashion. These representations are differentially engaged depending on whether the digits’ muscles are used for different motor actions such as ﬂexion movements, like grasping a ball or retraction movements like releasing a ball. This research provides a starting point for non-invasive investigation of mesoscale topography across layers and columns of the human cortex and bridges the gap between invasive electrophysiological investigations and large coverage non-invasive neuroimaging.},

Consequently, reported analyses often reduce the overall response curve to a single scalar value. In this study, we take a data-driven approach to HRF estimation at the whole-brain voxel level, without assuming a response profile at the individual level. We then employ a roughness penalty at the population level to estimate the response curve, aiming to enhance predictive accuracy, inferential efficiency, and cross-study reproducibility. By examining a fast event-related FMRI dataset, we demonstrate the shortcomings and information loss associated with adopting the canonical approach. Furthermore, we address the following key questions: 1) To what extent does the HRF shape vary across different regions, conditions, and participant groups? 2) Does the data-driven approach improve detection sensitivity compared to the canonical approach? 3) Can analyzing the HRF shape help validate the presence of an effect in conjunction with statistical evidence? 4) Does analyzing the HRF shape offer evidence for whole-brain response during a simple task?},

Previous studies in anesthetized monkeys found that inactivating feedback from extrastriate visual cortex produced effects in striate cortex that were relatively weak, generally suppressive, largest for visual stimuli confined to the receptive field center, and detectable only at low stimulus contrast. We studied the influence of corticocortical feedback in alert monkeys using cortical cooling to reversibly inactivate visual areas 2 (V2) and 3 (V3) while characterizing receptive field properties in primary visual cortex (V1). We show that inactivation of feedback from areas V2 and V3 results in both response suppression and facilitation for stimuli restricted to the receptive field center, in most cases leading to a small reduction in the degree of orientation selectivity but no change in orientation preference. For larger-diameter stimuli that engage regions beyond the center of the receptive field, eliminating feedback from V2 and V3 results in strong and consistent response facilitation, effectively reducing the strength of surround suppression in V1 for stimuli of both low and high contrast. For extended contours, eliminating feedback had the effect of reducing end stopping. Inactivation effects were largest for neurons that exhibited strong surround suppression before inactivation, and their timing matched the dynamics of surround suppression under control conditions. Our results provide direct evidence that feedback contributes to surround suppression, which is an important source of contextual influences essential to vision.},

Most cells (99/105, 94\%) through all cortical layers, exhibited suppression (mean reduction 67\%) to uniform stimuli exceeding the CRF, and 43\% exhibited a more than 70\% reduction. Testing with an annulus revealed two different patterns of surround influence. Some cells (37\% of cells), classical surround suppression (CSS) cells exhibited responses to an annulus encroaching on the CRF that were less than the plateau in the spatial summation curve. The majority (63\%), center-gated surround suppression (CGSS) cells, showed responses to annuli that equaled or exceeded the plateau in the spatial summation curve. Analysis suggested the CSS mechanism was implemented in all cells while the CGSS mechanism was implemented in varying strength across the sample with the extreme reflected in cells that gave larger responses to annuli than to a center stimulus. Reversing the direction of motion of the portion of the stimulus surrounding the CRF revealed four different patterns of effect: no reduction in the degree of suppression (22\% of cells), a reduction in surround suppression (41\%), a facilitation of the response above the level to the inner stimulus alone (37\%), and a facilitation of the response above that to the inner stimulus alone that also exceeded the values associated with an optimal inner stimulus. The facilitatory effects were only seen for reverse direction interfaces between the central and surrounding stimulus at diameters equal to or more than the CRF size. The zones driving the suppressive influences and the direction contrast facilitation were often spatially heterogeneous and for a number of cells bore strong comparison with the class of behavior reported for surround mechanisms in MT. This suggests a potential role, for example, in extracting information about motion contrast in the representation of the three dimensional structure of moving objects.},

Recent optical imaging observations of the time course of deoxyhemoglobin (HbR) and oxyhemoglobin have suggested that increases in oxygen consumption after neuronal activation occur earlier and are more spatially localized than the delayed and more diffuse CBF response. Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the present study, the temporal characteristics of CBF and BOLD changes elicited by somatosensory stimulation in rat were investigated by high-field (9.4 T) MRI. With use of high-temporal-resolution fMRI, it was found that the onset time of the CBF response in the somatosensory cortex was 0.6 ± 0.4 seconds (n = 10). The CBF changes occurred significantly earlier than changes in HbR concentration, which responded after 1.1 ± 0.3 seconds. Furthermore, no early increases in HbR (early negative BOLD signal changes) were observed. These findings argue against the occurrence of an early loss of hemoglobin oxygenation that precedes the rise in CBF and suggest that CBF and oxygen consumption increases may be dynamically coupled in this animal model of neural activation.},

            Neuronal activity in early visual cortex depends on attention shifts but the contribution to working memory has remained unclear. Here, we examine neuronal activity in the different layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) in an attention-demanding and a working memory task. A current-source density analysis reveales top-down inputs in the superficial layers and layer 5, and an increase in neuronal firing rates most pronounced in the superficial and deep layers and weaker in input layer 4. This increased activity is strongest in the attention task but it is also highly reliable during working memory delays. A visual mask erases the V1 memory activity, but it reappeares at a later point in time. These results provide new insights in the laminar circuits involved in the top-down modulation of activity in early visual cortex in the presence and absence of visual stimuli.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) respond best to oriented gratings of optimal size within their receptive field (RF) and are suppressed by larger gratings involving the nonclassical RF surround. A V1 neuron's optimal stimulus size is larger at lower stimulus contrast. A central question in visual neuroscience is what circuits generate the size tuning of V1 cells. We recently demonstrated that V1 horizontal connections integrate signals within a region of the RF center corresponding to the V1 neuron's optimal stimulus size at low contrast; extrastriate feedback connections to V1, instead, are longer range and can integrate signals from the most distant regions of the V1 cell's RF surround. Here, we have determined the contribution of geniculocortical feedforward and corticogeniculate feedback connections to the size-tuning of macaque V1 and lateral geniculate (LGN) neurons, respectively. Specifically, we have quantitatively compared the visuotopic extent of geniculate feedforward afferents to V1 with the size of the RF center and surround of neurons in the V1 input layers and the visuotopic extent of V1 feedback connections to the LGN with the RF size of cells in V1 layer 6, where these connections originate. We find geniculate feedforward connections to provide visuotopic information to V1 that is spatially coextensive with the V1 neuron's optimal stimulus size measured with high-contrast gratings. V1 feedback connections restrict their influence to an LGN region visuotopically coextensive with the size of the minimum response field (or classical RF) of V1 layer 6 cells and commensurate with the LGN region from which they receive feedforward connections.

We recorded local field potentials in the parafoveal representation in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized and paralyzed macaque monkeys with a multicontact electrode that provided for sampling of neural activity at 16 sites along a vertical penetration. Differential recordings at adjacent contacts were transformed into an estimate of current source density (CSD), to provide a measure of local neural activity. 2. We used m-sequence stimuli to map the region of visual space that provided input to the recording site. The local field potential recorded in macaque V1 has a population receptive field (PRF) size of approximately 2 deg2. 3. We assessed spatial tuning by the responses to two-dimensional Gaussian noise, spatially filtered to retain power only within one octave. Responses to achromatic band-limited noise stimuli revealed a prominent band-pass spatial tuning in the upper layers, but a more low-pass spatial tuning in lower layers. 4. We assessed orientation tuning by the responses to band-limited noise whose spectrum was further restricted to lie within 45 degrees wedges. The local field potential showed evidence of orientation tuning at most sites. Orientation tuning in upper and lower layers was manifest by systematic variations not only in response size but also in response dynamics. 5. We assessed chromatic tuning by the responses to isotropic band-limited noise modulated in a variety of directions in tristimulus space. Some lower-layer locations showed a nulling of response under near-isoluminant conditions. However, response dynamics in upper and lower layers depended not only on luminance contrast, but also on chromatic inputs. 6. Responses to near-isoluminant stimuli and to low-contrast luminance modulation were shifted to lower spatial frequencies. 7. We determined the extent to which various temporal frequencies in the response conveyed information concerning spatial frequency, orientation, and color under the steady-state conditions used in these studies. In each case, information is distributed in the response dynamics across a broad temporal frequency range, beginning at 4 Hz (the lowest frequency used). For spatial frequency the information rate remains significant up to at least 25 Hz. For orientation tuning and chromatic tuning, the information rate is lower overall and remains significant up to 13 Hz. In contrast, for texture discrimination, information is shifted to lower temporal frequencies.},

Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

We measured neural population activity [multiunit spike activity (MUA) and local field potential, LFP] in Macaque primary visual cortex (V1) in response to drifting grating stimuli. Sustained visually driven MUA was at an approximately constant level across cortical depth in V1. However, sustained, visually driven, local field potential power, which was concentrated in the γ-band (20–60 Hz), was greatest at the cortical depth corresponding to cortico-cortical output layers 2, 3, and 4B. γ-band power also tends to be more sustained in the output layers. Overall, cortico-cortical output layers accounted for 67\% of total γ-band activity in V1, whereas 56\% of total spikes evoked by drifting gratings were from layers 2, 3, and 4B. The high-resolution layer specificity of γ-band power, the laminar distribution of MUA and γ-band activity, and their dynamics imply that neural activity in V1 is generated by laminar-specific mechanisms. In particular, visual responses of MUA and γ-band activity in cortico-cortical output layers 2, 3, and 4B seem to be strongly influenced by laminar-specific recurrent circuitry and/or feedback.},
